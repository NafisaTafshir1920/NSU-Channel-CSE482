# NSU-Channel-CSE482
The information system for communication with alumni embodies one of many ways how the university can keep tracking of its graduates. Except for communication between the university and its graduates, the information system should allow communication between graduates themselves and their personal presentation in public. The system also should collect actual information about the working experience of graduates, which can improve faculty credits and the teaching process. The presented information system includes all these points and focuses on usability and a comfortable user interface. The aim of this project is to build an Alumni of North South University online dashboard. The project manages the fresh as well as old graduate students with their respective information in actively participating in registering, searching, managing the alumni information for sharing their expertise, network, jobs opportunities and resources. The design and implementation of the NSU CHANNEL will be available for general public use through the web interface. A non-registered visitor can look at the list of graduates according to a year of graduation or field of study. He can also look at graduates profiles. The level of profile details shown to the public is limited. By default, a public visitor can only see the name and surname of a graduate, year of graduation, and field of study. The faculty endeavors to propagate its graduates. Therefore graduates can also add some information about themselves into the system during the study such as working experience, knowledge. Graduates can enable to display this information in their profiles for public visitors.
